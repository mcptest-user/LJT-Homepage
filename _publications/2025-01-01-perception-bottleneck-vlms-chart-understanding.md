This research explores the perception bottleneck in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) when applied to chart understanding tasks. We identify key limitations in current VLMs' ability to accurately perceive and interpret visual information from charts, and propose novel approaches to mitigate these issues, leading to improved performance on chart understanding benchmarks.
