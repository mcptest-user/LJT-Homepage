This research investigates novel approaches for composing parameter-efficient modules using arithmetic operations. We demonstrate that arithmetic composition of modules can significantly enhance model adaptation capabilities while maintaining parameter efficiency, providing new insights into efficient model fine-tuning and adaptation strategies for large-scale language models.
